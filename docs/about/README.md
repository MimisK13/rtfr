# About RTFR

**RTFR** (Read The Fucking Rider) is a living documentation project for musicians, audio engineers, and stage crews.

Its goal is simple:  
ðŸ‘‰ To make technical riders less painful, more useful, and actually read.

## Why this exists

- Because no one teaches you how to write a proper rider
- Because engineers get vague PDFs full of nonsense
- Because bands waste time on stage over things that should be agreed on before the gig

## What this project is

- A guide to writing and interpreting tech riders
- A reference for common practices in live audio & stage production
- A place to share and evolve standards with the community

## What this project is NOT

- A one-size-fits-all solution
- A promoter's wishlist
- A rider full of diva demands
