# Backline

The backline section lists all musical instruments and equipment the artist requires to be provided on stage, unless they’re bringing their own. This may include drums, amps, keyboards, stands, DJ gear, and more.

A clear backline section ensures the local production knows what to rent, what to prepare, and what not to assume.

## What should this section include?

What the artist brings

Be explicit: “Artist will provide own guitar amps and pedalboards.”

What must be provided locally

Specify brand, model, size, and acceptable alternatives.

Configuration and accessories

Cymbal stands, drum throne, keyboard stand type (X, Z, 2-tier), sustain pedals, amp head vs cabinet, etc.

DJ setups

CDJ models, mixers (e.g. “2x CDJ-3000 and 1x DJM-A9”), laptop stands, table height.

Backup gear

Optional but helpful to state: “Please provide backup snare and kick pedal if possible.”

### Tips
- Avoid vague requests like “good quality amp”. Always list make and model, or at least “or equivalent”.
- Specify what you don’t need, e.g. “no cymbals required” or “we do not need amps for keys”.
