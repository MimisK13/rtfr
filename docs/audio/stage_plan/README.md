# Stage Plot (Stage Plan)

The stage plot is a **visual diagram** that shows the placement of all musicians, instruments, monitors, and technical gear on stage. It works hand-in-hand with the input list and monitor mix section, giving the crew a complete picture of the setup before load-in.

## What should a stage plot include?

- **Position of each musician**
    - Clearly indicate where each band member stands/sits.
- **Labeled inputs and instruments**
    - Each mic, DI, amp, or instrument should be labeled according to the input list.
- **Monitor wedges or IEM packs**
    - Include wedges or wireless pack locations and label them (e.g. Mix 1, Mix 2, etc).
- **Backline equipment**
    - Guitar/bass amps, drum kit, keyboard stands, DJ tables, etc.
- **Stage dimensions** (optional but helpful)
    - For example: “Minimum stage width 6m, depth 4m”
- **Legend / Key**
    - Use color codes or icons to clarify meaning if needed.

## Sample Description (if no drawing is provided)

- Drums center-back.
- Bass stage right with amp and Mix 3 monitor wedge.
- Guitar stage left with amp and Mix 4 wedge.
- Keys stage right front, stereo DI, Mix 5 wedge.
- Lead vocal center-front with Mix 2 wedge.
- Backing vocals stage left and right, Mix 6 shared wedge.
- 6 monitor mixes total.

## How to deliver the stage plot

- Attach it as a **PDF or image file**.
- Use simple diagramming tools such as:
    - [StagePlotPro](https://www.stageplot.com/)
    - [draw.io (Diagram.net)](https://www.diagrams.net/)
    - Canva, Sketch, Figma, or even PowerPoint.
- Keep the file name clear, e.g. `BandName_StagePlot.pdf`.

> 💡 **Best Practice:** Keep the stage plot **simple, readable, and accurate**. If it hasn’t been updated in years, it’s probably wrong.
