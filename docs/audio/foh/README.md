## [PA](/glossary.md#PA)

This section of a technical rider outlines the sound system expectations from the artist or band. It’s crucial that this information is clear and specific so that audio technicians can prepare an appropriate system and ensure a successful show.

### What should this section include?

- **Target SPL:** The minimum sound pressure level expected at the Front of House (FOH) position. Example:
“The system must deliver at least 105 dB(A) continuous SPL at FOH with +6 dB headroom.”

- **Coverage:** Even distribution of sound throughout the audience area, typically within ±3 dB from front to back.

- **Frequency Response:** Full-range reproduction, e.g. “35 Hz – 18 kHz ±3 dB.”

- **Subwoofer Configuration:** Preferences such as cardioid or end-fired subs, and quantity relative to the room size.

- **Preferred Brands:** Mention of trusted manufacturers (optional but helpful).
Example: “L-Acoustics, d&b audiotechnik, Meyer Sound, or equivalent.”

- **System Engineer:** A qualified system tech should be present during load-in, system tuning, and soundcheck.

### Sample

> A high-quality, full-range PA system must be provided, capable of delivering at least 105 dB(A) continuous SPL at FOH with even ±3 dB coverage throughout the venue. 
> Subwoofers should be cardioid or end-fired where possible and aligned with the main system. 
> Preferred systems include L-Acoustics, d&b audiotechnik, Meyer Sound, or equivalent. 
> A qualified system technician must be present for system tuning and show operation.

## Mixing Desks

This section communicates which mixing consoles the artist prefers or requires — both at Front of House (FOH) and for stage monitors. If the artist is touring with their own consoles or engineers, that should be stated clearly. It’s also important to indicate whether a digital split or analog split is needed.

### What should this section include?

- Preferred FOH console(s)

List a few acceptable models, e.g.:

- `Preferred FOH console: Avid S6L, DiGiCo SD12, or Yamaha CL5.`

- If touring with own console: “Artist will provide FOH console (Midas M32). Local crew must provide power and XLR tie-ins.”


- Preferred Monitor console(s)
Indicate whether monitors are mixed from FOH or a separate console. Examples:

- “Dedicated monitor console required. Preferred: DiGiCo SD11, Yamaha QL5.”

- “Monitors will be mixed from FOH. Ensure console has minimum 6 aux sends.”


- Split & I/O requirements

- State whether a digital split is possible or if a traditional analog split snake is needed.

Specify if the band brings its own stage box or needs one provided.

Scene recall or show files

If using digital consoles:
“Show files will be provided in advance for Yamaha CL/QL and Allen & Heath dLive.”

### Sample

> Preferred FOH console: Avid S6L, DiGiCo SD12, or Yamaha CL5.
> 
> Preferred Monitor console: DiGiCo SD11, Yamaha QL5.
> 
> Split & I/O requirements: Digital split.
> 
> Scene recall or show files: Yamaha CL/QL and Allen & Heath dLive.

::: warning
Don’t request a console you’re not familiar with.
If you’re not comfortable working quickly and confidently on a specific desk, 
don’t list it as a preference just because it’s "high-end" or popular. 
A well-operated mid-range console is better than a flagship one you don’t know how to drive.

### Outboards

In the digital world this section is optional. In most cases, our digital desk covers all needs.

But there are also cases where we need external processors (FX Units, Dynamics Prossecors).

> 1 x Lexicon PCM 60
> 
> 1 x Lexicon PCM 91
>
> 1 x TC D-TWO
> 
> 1 x Avalon 2044 (PA)

In the analog world this section is mandatory, as the need for external processors imposes.

> 4ch x Gate
>
> 8ch x Compressor
>
> 1 x Stereo Graphic EQ (PA)
>
> 1 x Lexicon PCM 60
