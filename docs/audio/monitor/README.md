# Monitor Mix Needs

This section describes how many monitor mixes are required on stage, what each mix should include, and whether the artist uses wedge monitors, in-ear monitors (IEMs), or both. It helps the monitor engineer prepare a layout in advance and reduces setup time during soundcheck.

### What should this section include?

- **Total number of mixes**
Specify how many independent mixes are needed. Example:
'6 separate monitor mixes required.'

- **Type of monitoring**
Clarify the system type for each performer:

- `Drummer and vocalist use IEMs.`

- `All other members use wedges.`

- **Mix content per position**
Give a rough idea of what each performer wants to hear. For example:

## Sample

> 6 separate monitor mixes required:
> - Mix 1 (Drummer – IEM): Kick, Snare, Bass, Click
> - Mix 2 (Lead Vocal – Wedge): Lead Vocals, Guitar, Keys, Backing Vox
> - Mix 3 (Bass – Wedge): Bass, Kick, Snare, Vocals
> - Mix 4 (Guitar – Wedge): Guitar, Lead Vocals, Kick
> - Mix 5 (Keys – Wedge): Keys, Lead Vocals, Bass
> - Mix 6 (Backing Vocals – Shared Wedge): Backing Vox, Lead Vocals
>
> Artist provides IEM system for drummer. Venue must supply 5 powered wedges of equal make/model.
> 
> Talkback mic required from FOH to Mixes 1 and 2.
