# Introduction

**Technical riders** are documents that explain the technical needs of a live act — sound, stage, lighting, and hospitality.

They are not "rockstar demands". They're a communication tool.

## A good rider...

- Prevents misunderstandings
- Speeds up setup and soundcheck
- Protects both artists and venues

## A bad rider...

- Is vague, outdated, or missing
- Creates stress, improvisation, and frustration
- Can even ruin a show

This site exists to help everyone do better — whether you're on tour, behind the console, or under the stage.
