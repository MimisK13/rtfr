# Input List


## Columns
* Channel Number
* Instrument/Line Name
* Type (Mic / DI / XLR)
* Stand (Short Boom, Tall Boom, Clip)

## Color Coding
In more complex cases, with common instruments or musicians who have more than one line, it is good practice to group the lines by musician. 
An easy way is to define position or musician by color.
