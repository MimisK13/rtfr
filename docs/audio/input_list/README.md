# Input List

The input list is a detailed breakdown of all audio sources that need to be micâ€™d or DIâ€™d during the performance. 
It typically includes the channel number, source name, microphone or DI preference, and sometimes monitor send references.

Itâ€™s essential that the input list is:

- Clear and ordered by channel number
- Consistent with the stage plot
- Reflective of the actual setup used live

What should this section include?
- Channel number (1, 2, 3â€¦)
- Instrument/source name (e.g. Kick In, Snare Top, Bass DI)
- Mic/DI preference (optional, but helpful)
- Phantom power requirements
- Notes (e.g. stereo pairs, shares with backline DI)

Optional columns:
- Monitor sends (e.g. which mixes need that signal)
- Subgroups (if artist uses a specific routing scheme)

## Tips

- Donâ€™t forget to list any playback channels, talkbacks, or tracks (click/cue).
- If stereo channels are used, label both sides (e.g. Keys L/R).
- If youâ€™re using a digital stagebox, make sure input numbers align with the patch.

## Color Coding

In complex setups â€” especially with large ensembles, multiple similar instruments, or musicians who have multiple lines (e.g. vocals + keys) â€” itâ€™s good practice to group inputs by musician or position using color codes.

This helps both the FOH and monitor engineers quickly identify which inputs belong together during patching or troubleshooting.

`How to implement:`

- Assign a color to each musician (e.g. blue for drummer, green for bass player).
- Use that color consistently across:
    Input list
    Stage plot
- Channel labels on console or stagebox
- If delivering the input list as a spreadsheet or PDF, apply background color or highlight to rows by group.

`Example`

| CH | Source   | Mic/DI     | Notes    | Color (Group)     |
| -- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 1  | Kick In  | Beta 91A   | Inside   | **Blue (Drums)**  |
| 2  | Kick Out | Beta 52A   | Outside  | **Blue (Drums)**  |
| 10 | Bass DI  | Radial J48 |          | **Green (Bass)**  |
| 14 | Keys L   | DI         | Stereo L | **Yellow (Keys)** |
| 15 | Keys R   | DI         | Stereo R | **Yellow (Keys)** |

ðŸ’¡ You donâ€™t need to overdo it â€” just enough to help the tech team group and prioritize during setup.
