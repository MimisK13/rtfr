# Formatting Matters

How a rider looks is just as important as what it says.

Technical crews — especially sound and light engineers — often have just a few minutes to skim through a rider. Good formatting helps them find what they need without frustration.

## Basic Structure

- Use **clear section titles** for AUDIO, LIGHTS, VIDEO, and HOSPITALITY.
- Make sure each section starts on a new page if exporting to PDF.
- Keep all related items grouped together (e.g. input list + stage plot in AUDIO).

## Layout & Readability

- Use bold or colored headers to define sections.
- Use bullet points or tables for clarity.
- Don’t cram everything into one paragraph — white space helps.
- Use fixed-width fonts for input lists (e.g. Consolas, Courier New).

## Visual Cues

- Group channels in the input list by musician, using color or shaded rows.
- Assign a unique color to each monitor mix and reflect it in the stage plot.
- Use consistent labels: if you say “Lead Vox” in the input list, don’t say “Main Vocal” in the monitor section.

## Summary

> Don't make your rider look like a random text dump.  
> Good formatting = faster setup, fewer mistakes, happier techs.
